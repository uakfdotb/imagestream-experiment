This is an implementation of the experiment in "Embracing Error to Enable Rapid
Crowdsourcing" [1].

To compile:

	go build imagestream.go

Initialize the MySQL database:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE imagestream;
	mysql> use imagestream;
	mysql> source schema.sql;

You will need to add qualification and experimental images to
static/images/qual and static/images/data. The filenames of the images in both
sets must be in the format "[numeric ID].png", e.g. "100.png". The
qualification images need to start from 0.png and go up to 200.png.

Once the images are compiled, insert the experimental images into the database.
For each image:

	INSERT INTO images (id, is_in_class) VALUES (0, 1);

Here, 'static/images/data/0.png' is in the class.

To run an experiment, start by inserting a row into the experiments table:

	INSERT INTO experiments (id, total_images) VALUES ('test', 100);

The experiment must be initialized before it can be used. Initialization
involves randomly selecting a set of experimental images and dividing those
images up into tasks for users.

	./imagestream -mode init -expid test

You can now serve the experiment. The application will listen on
127.0.0.1:8080.

	./imagestream -mode serve -expid test

You can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to run the experiment. Once all tasks
are completed (check with SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE completed = 0), you
can evaluate the performance of the conventional and rapid approaches. For the
rapid approach, you will need to supply a threshold; only images that score
above the threshold (where score is computed by summing the Gaussian
probability distribution across the clicks of all users) will be predicted as
being in the class.

	./imagestream -mode eval -expid test -threshold 0.005
